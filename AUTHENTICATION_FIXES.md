# Authentication State Management Fixes

## Problem Summary

The profile page was displaying incorrect user data after logging in with different credentials due to several authentication state management issues:

1. **Stale React Query Cache**: Profile queries weren't properly invalidated when switching users
2. **Missing Query Dependencies**: Profile queries didn't depend on access tokens, so they didn't refetch when tokens changed
3. **Incomplete State Synchronization**: Auth store hydration only happened on app load
4. **Axios Interceptor Issues**: Token refresh logic had syntax errors and didn't properly update the auth store

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Auth Store (`src/store/auth-store.ts`)

- Added `userId` field to track the current user
- Added `updateTokens` method for token refresh scenarios
- Added `clearAuth` method for complete state cleanup
- Created `useAuth` custom hook for better state management
- Added computed properties: `isAuthenticated` and `isReady`

### 2. Improved Profile Query (`src/app/profile/page.tsx`)

- Updated query key to include `accessToken` and `userId`: `["profile", accessToken, userId]`
- Set `staleTime: 0` and `gcTime: 0` to prevent caching
- Added retry functionality in error state
- Used new `useAuth` hook for better state management

### 3. Enhanced Auth API (`src/lib/api/auth-api.ts`)

- Updated `handleAuthSuccess` to extract and store user ID from login response
- Improved cache invalidation by removing both `["profile"]` and `["user"]` queries
- Better error handling and state cleanup

### 4. Fixed Axios Interceptors (`src/lib/api/request.ts`)

- Fixed TypeScript errors with proper typing for retry flags
- Improved token refresh logic with proper error handling
- Added automatic auth store updates when tokens are refreshed
- Better queue management for concurrent requests during token refresh

### 5. Updated Login Flow (`src/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx`)

- Added automatic redirect if user is already authenticated
- Better loading states while auth state is being determined
- Improved error handling

### 6. Enhanced Logout Flow (`src/components/ui/LogoutButton.tsx`)

- Added `clearAuth` call for complete state cleanup
- Better error handling during logout process

### 7. Development Tools

- Added `AuthDebug` component for monitoring auth state during development
- Shows current authentication status, tokens, and user ID
- Includes cache clearing functionality for testing

## How to Test the Fixes

### Prerequisites

1. Ensure your backend API is running on `http://localhost:3000/api/v1`
2. Have at least two different user accounts available for testing

### Testing Steps

#### 1. Basic Authentication Flow

1. **Start the application**: `npm run dev`
2. **Navigate to login page**: `http://localhost:3001/login`
3. **Login with first user**: Enter credentials and submit
4. **Verify profile loads**: Should see first user's data
5. **Logout**: Click logout button
6. **Login with second user**: Enter different credentials
7. **Verify correct data**: Should see second user's data, not first user's

#### 2. Cache Invalidation Test

1. **Login with first user**
2. **Navigate to profile**: Verify first user's data is displayed
3. **Open browser dev tools**: Go to Network tab
4. **Login with second user**: Without refreshing the page
5. **Check network requests**: Should see new profile request with different user data
6. **Verify UI updates**: Profile should show second user's data

#### 3. Token Refresh Test

1. **Login with any user**
2. **Wait for token to expire** (or manually expire it on backend)
3. **Perform an action** that triggers an API call
4. **Verify automatic refresh**: Should see token refresh request
5. **Verify continued functionality**: App should continue working without re-login

#### 4. Concurrent User Switch Test

1. **Open two browser tabs/windows**
2. **Login with different users** in each tab
3. **Navigate to profile** in both tabs
4. **Verify isolation**: Each tab should show correct user data
5. **Switch between tabs**: Data should remain correct for each user

#### 5. Development Debug Tool

1. **Open the app in development mode**
2. **Look for debug panel**: Bottom-right corner black panel
3. **Monitor auth state**: Shows ready status, authentication status, token presence
4. **Test cache clearing**: Click "Clear Cache" button to manually clear React Query cache
5. **Verify state updates**: Debug panel should update in real-time

### Expected Behavior

After implementing these fixes:

- ✅ **Profile data is always correct** for the currently logged-in user
- ✅ **No stale data** from previous users
- ✅ **Automatic token refresh** works seamlessly
- ✅ **Proper cache invalidation** when switching users
- ✅ **Consistent state** across all components
- ✅ **Better error handling** and user feedback
- ✅ **Development tools** for debugging auth issues

### Troubleshooting

If you still experience issues:

1. **Check the debug panel** in development mode
2. **Clear browser cookies** and local storage
3. **Check network tab** for failed requests
4. **Verify backend API** is returning correct user data
5. **Check console logs** for error messages

### Key Files Modified

- `src/store/auth-store.ts` - Enhanced state management
- `src/app/profile/page.tsx` - Improved query configuration
- `src/lib/api/auth-api.ts` - Better auth success handling
- `src/lib/api/request.ts` - Fixed axios interceptors
- `src/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx` - Enhanced login flow
- `src/components/ui/LogoutButton.tsx` - Improved logout handling
- `src/components/ui/auth-debug.tsx` - Development debugging tool
- `src/app/layout.tsx` - Added debug component

## Technical Details

### Query Key Strategy

The profile query now uses a composite key: `["profile", accessToken, userId]`

This ensures:

- Query refetches when access token changes
- Query refetches when user ID changes
- Proper cache isolation between different users

### State Synchronization

The auth store now properly synchronizes:

- Cookies (persistent storage)
- Zustand store (in-memory state)
- React Query cache (data cache)

### Token Refresh Flow

1. Request fails with 401
2. Token refresh request is made
3. New tokens are stored in auth store and cookies
4. Failed request is retried with new token
5. Queued requests are processed with new token

This ensures seamless token refresh without user interruption.
